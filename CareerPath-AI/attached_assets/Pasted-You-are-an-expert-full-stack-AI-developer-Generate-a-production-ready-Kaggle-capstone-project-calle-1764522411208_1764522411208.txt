You are an expert full-stack AI developer.
Generate a production-ready Kaggle capstone project called "CareerPath AI".

UI Requirement:
- Use the exact UI concept provided by the user (a dashboard they built yesterday). Do NOT change the layout idea.
- The dashboard contains sections like: Resume Analyzer, Job Match, Career Roadmap, and optionally Projects if resume includes it.
- The Projects section should ONLY appear if found in resume; otherwise hide it automatically.
- Use modern grid/card layout with smooth rounded panels, left sidebar, and clean spacing.
- Include real-time page transitions and animations using Streamlit-compatible libraries like streamlit-lottie or streamlit-extras.
- Add real-time element transitions (fade-in, slide-in, zoom-in on cards and text when switching sections).
- Add a top progress bar or loader animation during AI analysis.
- Add micro-transitions to inputs, results, and roadmap generation (delayed reveal lines, animated metrics, live typing effect optional).
- Maintain professionalism and Kaggle-project aesthetics.

Core Features:
1. **Resume Analyzer**
   - Upload PDF or DOCX → extract text reliably → analyze ATS score, skills, missing keywords, structured feedback.
   - Output must animate into view (fade or slide).

2. **Job Matcher**
   - Job description input compares skills → similarity scoring logic must be realistic and accurate.

3. **Career Path Planner**
   - Generate roadmap with stage-wise transitions (e.g., Step 1 loads then slides in, Step 2 reveals after delay, etc).

4. **Projects Section**
   - If resume contains real project details → show it in UI with selectable real-time animated cards.
   - If missing → do NOT generate the tab or empty section.

Tech & Code Rules:
- Use free AI API only (choose one like Groq LLaMA, Mistral, Gemini, OpenAI free tier, or etc).
- Use SQLite or PostgreSQL with **correct SQL schema** to store: ATS score, matched role, missing skills, roadmap.
- Code must run on Replit with no import errors, missing commands, or version issues.
- Provide a working `requirements.txt` with valid compatible versions.
- Main file must be `app.py`
- Add full error handling for file upload/extraction and API failures.
- ATS score logic must be deterministic, based on keyword match %, formatting penalties, and skill coverage — no fake randomness.

UX Enhancements:
- Real-time transition effects between:
    * sidebar navigation
    * resume analysis result
    * job-match comparison
    * career roadmap steps
- Add interactive transitions like:
    * cards sliding in when job matches increase
    * ATS metrics counting up live instead of flashing
    * roadmap steps appearing one by one with fade

Return ONLY project files in correct folder structure + working code.

Folder Structure needed:
│ CareerPath AI
│  ├── app.py
│  ├── requirements.txt
│  ├── schema.sql or database.db
│  └── utils/
│        ├── resume_parser.py
│        └── ats_scorer.py
